# AzureFilesTierVerify
This Powershell Script will confirm if there are any Azure-Tiered files in a given path and reports the files and statistics on those.

Run the Powershell Script, and update the first line to point to the folder/drive you wish to interrogate.
Run as Administrator to ensure full access to the file store. 

It will return a tally of the files that are flagged as offline and will need to be recalled.
